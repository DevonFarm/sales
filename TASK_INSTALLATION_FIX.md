# ✅ Task Runner Installation Fix

## Problem Fixed

The GitHub Actions pipeline was failing with:
```
/home/runner/work/_temp/cbe12f8a-bda1-4930-a5f5-9b06e67aa519.sh: line 1: task: command not found
```

## Solution Applied

Added `task` installation step to all jobs that use task commands.

## ✅ Jobs Updated

### 1. **unit-tests** Job
```yaml
- name: Install task runner
  run: go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest

- name: Run unit tests
  run: task test-unit
```

### 2. **handler-tests** Job
```yaml
- name: Install task runner
  run: go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest

# Uses: task db-migrate, task test-handlers
```

### 3. **handler-tests** Job
```yaml
- name: Install task runner
  run: go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest

- name: Run handler tests
  run: task test-handlers
```

### 4. **e2e-tests** Job
```yaml
- name: Install task runner
  run: go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest

# Uses: task db-migrate, task test-e2e
```

## ✅ Installation Details

- **Method**: `go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest`
- **Timing**: Installed after Go setup, before any task commands
- **Version**: Latest stable version (v3)
- **Scope**: Per-job installation (each job installs its own copy)

## 🚀 Expected Results

All jobs should now run successfully:
- ✅ `task test-unit` will work in unit-tests job
- ✅ `task test-handlers` will work in handler-tests job  
- ✅ `task test-handlers` will work in handler-tests job
- ✅ `task test-e2e` will work in e2e-tests job
- ✅ `task db-migrate` will work in handler-tests and e2e-tests jobs

## 📝 Notes

- **security-scan** and **lint** jobs don't use task commands, so no installation needed
- Each job installs task independently for isolation
- Installation happens after Go setup to ensure `go install` command is available
- Uses the same task version (v3) as specified in the local development setup

The "command not found" error should now be resolved! 🎉
